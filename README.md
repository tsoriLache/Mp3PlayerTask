## Basic functions you should know about:

- `playSong` - Gets a song ID and number of song to play automatically(optional), and plays it by printing it's data.
- `removeSong` - Gets a song ID, and removes it from the player (from songs and playlists).
- `addSong` - Gets a title, album, artist, duration(`mm:ss`) & ID(optional).  
- `removePlaylist` - Gets a playlist ID. Remove the playlist from the player.
- `createPlaylist` - Gets a name & ID(optional). Creates a new, empty playlist with the given details.
- `playPlaylist` - Gets a playlist ID. Plays all songs in the playlist.
- `editPlaylist` - Gets a playlist ID & a song ID: -If the song ID exists in the playlist, removes it. 
                                                   -If it was the only song in the playlist, also deletes the playlist. 
                                                   -If the song ID does not exist in the playlist, adds it to the end of the playlist.
- `playlistDuration` - Gets a playlist ID. Returns the total duration of the entire playlist.
- `searchByQuery` - Gets a query string. search in songs(title,album and artist) and playlists. 
- `searchByDuration` - Gets a duration in `mm:ss` format (for example 01:03). Returns the song, or playlist, with the closest duration to what was given.

__Note__: The functions are not yet merge to the main branch.


## Additions
- `shufflePlaylist` -play any playlist in random order.
- `autoPlay` - automatically play next song.(insted of adding it as new function I updated playSong so you can choose how many song you want it to play automatically(randomly),if you don't choose it plays only the song that match the ID.)


__Note__: The functions are not yet merge to the main branch.

## bugs /errors
- The autoPlay adittion choose the songs the next song randomly from all the songs in the playerâ€¦so if you don't have many songs it will probably repeat the same songs all the time! maybe even 2 or 3 times in a row.



### If you have anything to add or comment I would love it.
